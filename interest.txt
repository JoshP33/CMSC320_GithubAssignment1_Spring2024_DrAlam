Why are you interested in taking CMSC320?

I am interested in taking CMSC320 because I want to learn more about data management systems. I do not know
a lot about SQL or using Python, and I believe these will be valuable skills to know. 
I am also interested in data visualization and hope we cover that this semester. During my internship this past summer
we often worked with large data sets and when it took time to compress that data and create a Powerpoint, it was preferred
that we make it easy to view and understandable by those who were not involved in the project. That is why I think learning how to condense
data and turning it into a graph or another form of visualization would be extremely helpful in the workplace.
